## 🚀 About Me

I’m a **smart contract engineer, protocol researcher, and full-stack Web3 builder** with **6+ years** of experience shipping production systems across:

- **DeFi protocols** and on-chain marketplaces  
- **Modular rollups** (Celestia / Rollkit / Ethermint)  
- **Explorers & verification tooling**  
- **FHE & cryptography-driven applications**  
- **Decentralized education & media protocols**

I’ve contributed to **audited, production-grade DeFi**, designed **sovereign rollup architectures**, built **developer tooling** for real networks, and taught **30+ students** Solidity, EVM internals, and security.

Right now I’m focused on:

- Advanced **Solidity/Yul** engineering  
- **Protocol / infra** design on modular stacks  
- **DED**, a decentralized education protocol for verifiable, peer-to-peer learning

## ⭐ Featured Work

### 🔹 DED — Decentralized Education Development (Founder, Active)

**DED** is a protocol and platform for **permissionless, trust-minimized, peer-to-peer education**.

It explores:

- **Verifiable learning sessions**  
  - On-chain commitments around live instruction  
  - Identity-agnostic participation with cryptographic guarantees  

- **Transparent payment & escrow flows**  
  - Conditional settlement and dispute-aware escrows  
  - Incentive-aligned economics for students and instructors  

- **Decentralized credentialing**  
  - “Proof-of-learning” artifacts  
  - Non-transferable completion receipts and on-chain skill attestations  

- **Replayable, permissioned sessions**  
  - Controlled access to session recordings  
  - Rental / licensing flows enforced on-chain  

Implementation spans **Solidity**, **rollup-friendly design**, and **WebRTC-driven live sessions**.  
Current status: **MVP contracts + frontend + WebRTC integration** on testnet, pushing toward mainnet.
