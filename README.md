# 👋 Hey, I’m **Harris Levine** — Blockchain Engineer & Educator

I build secure smart contracts, modular blockchain systems, and full-stack Web3 applications.  
I’ve worked on production protocols, modular rollups, NFT infrastructure, FHE playgrounds, and I teach 30+ students blockchain & Solidity from the ground up.  
I’m also building a decentralized EdTech platform focused on open-access knowledge and long-term decentralized content storage.
