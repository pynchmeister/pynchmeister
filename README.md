## 🚀 **About Me**

I’m a **senior smart contract engineer & full-stack blockchain developer** with **6+ years** of experience building:

- Production-grade **DeFi protocols**  
- **Modular rollups** (Celestia / Rollkit / Ethermint)  
- Secure, gas-optimized **Solidity/Yul smart contracts**  
- Cryptographic systems and emerging blockchain primitives  
- On-chain **NFT protocols**, verifiable storage, and decentralized tooling  
- Scalable Web3 infrastructure used in real applications  

I’ve shipped real-world protocol features, architected sovereign rollup components, built developer tooling, and taught **30+ students** blockchain development, EVM internals, and Solidity design patterns.

Currently focused on advanced Solidity engineering, backend infra, and real-world protocol architecture.

## ⭐ **Featured Projects**

### 🔹 **DED — Decentralized Education Protocol (Private MVP)**  

**DED (Decentralized Education Delivery)** is a protocol I’ve been designing that enables **permissionless, trust-minimized, peer-to-peer education** using blockchain primitives.

DED targets a core problem in online learning: there is no verifiable, open, decentralized system for **live instruction, credentialing, and skill exchange**.

At a high level, DED explores:

- **Verifiable learning sessions**  
  - On-chain commitments around live, synchronous instruction  
  - Identity-agnostic participation and instructor guarantees  
  - Cryptographically verifiable participation (without revealing sensitive details)

- **Transparent, on-chain payment flows**  
  - Conditional settlement and escrow-style mechanics  
  - Incentive-aligned flows for both students and instructors  
  - A foundation for fair, dispute-resistant compensation

- **Decentralized credentialing**  
  - “Proof-of-learning” style artifacts  
  - On-chain skill attestations and participation receipts  
  - Non-transferable representations of completed sessions or skill milestones  

- **Session replays with permissioned access**  
  - Hosts can grant or revoke replay access  
  - Participants can potentially rent or license session recordings under defined conditions  

All implementation details and protocol mechanics are private until launch, but my work covers:

- Protocol research and design  
- Solidity contract architecture  
- Session and verification model  
- Economic and incentive modeling  
- Early MVP implementation and system diagrams  

DED synthesizes my experience across **Solidity**, **modular chains**, **on-chain media**, and **decentralized education systems**.

### 🔹 **Contract Verification System (Modular Cloud)**  

A decentralized contract verification and explorer tooling stack integrating **Sourcify**, serverless indexing, and a full UI for contract metadata and source verification.

**Highlights:**

- Contract verification flows integrated with Sourcify  
- TypeScript/Next.js front-end components  
- APIs and schema design for contract/source metadata  
- Developer-facing UX for interacting with on-chain metadata  

**Tech:** Solidity, Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma

### 🔹 **Etch — NFT Social Protocol (NDA Project)**  

**Private Repo (Code Restricted Under NDA)**  

Etch is an **NFT-powered social media platform** that enables creators, educators, and communities to publish, collect, and interact with on-chain media in a more flexible and expressive way than traditional Web2 platforms.

My role on Etch focuses on the **core smart contract architecture** and protocol integration work, including:

- Designing modular NFT primitives to support dynamic media objects  
- Architecting ownership, access control, and permissioning flows  
- Implementing secure and efficient minting and metadata patterns  
- Integrating the protocol with backend/indexing infrastructure  
- Ensuring upgrade safety and forward-compatible contract design  

All implementation details remain private under NDA, but the work heavily leverages **Solidity**, **protocol and data modeling**, and the intersection of **social platforms and on-chain assets**.

**Tech:** Solidity, Foundry, Angular, TypeScript

### 🔹 **Wells (Renamed Basin) DEX — Beanstalk Farms**  

On-chain ERC-20 exchange with:

- Gas-optimized Yul components  
- Fuzz testing and invariants  
- Audit-ready modular design  

My contributions include working within the Wells/Basin codebase on smart contract logic, optimizations, and testing patterns that support production-grade DeFi infrastructure.

**Tech:** Solidity, Yul, Foundry, Hardhat  

Repo: https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Basin

### 🔹 **Yul / Low-Level EVM Research**  

Deep dives, experiments, and implementation patterns in low-level EVM & Yul, including:

- Assembly-level experiments  
- Gas optimization techniques  
- Micro-patterns useful for DeFi primitives and protocol internals  

**Tech:** Yul, Assembly, Foundry
