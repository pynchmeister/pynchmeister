## 🚀 **About Me**

I’m a **senior smart contract engineer & full-stack blockchain developer** with **6+ years** of experience building:

- Production-grade **DeFi protocols**  
- **Modular rollups** (Celestia / Rollkit / Ethermint)  
- Secure, gas-optimized **Solidity/Yul smart contracts**  
- Cryptographic systems and emerging blockchain primitives  
- On-chain **NFT protocols**, verifiable storage, and decentralized tooling  
- Scalable Web3 infrastructure used in real applications  

I’ve shipped real-world protocol features, architected sovereign rollup components, built developer tooling, and taught **30+ students** blockchain development, EVM internals, and Solidity design patterns.

Currently focused on advanced Solidity engineering, backend infra, and real-world protocol architecture.

## ⭐ **Featured Projects**

### 🔹 **DED — Decentralized Education Protocol (Private MVP)**  

**DED (Decentralized Education Delivery)** is a protocol I’ve been designing that enables **permissionless, trust-minimized, peer-to-peer education** using blockchain primitives.

DED targets a core problem in online learning: there is no verifiable, open, decentralized system for **live instruction, credentialing, and skill exchange**.

At a high level, DED explores:

- **Verifiable learning sessions**  
  - On-chain commitments around live, synchronous instruction  
  - Identity-agnostic participation and instructor guarantees  
  - Cryptographically verifiable participation without exposing sensitive data

- **Transparent, on-chain payment flows**  
  - Conditional settlement and escrow patterns  
  - Incentive-aligned instructor and student mechanics  
  - Fair, dispute-resistant economic flows

- **Decentralized credentialing**  
  - “Proof-of-learning” artifacts  
  - On-chain skill attestations and participation receipts  
  - Non-transferable completion proofs  

- **Session replays with permissioned access**  
  - Hosts can grant/revoke replay access  
  - Participants can rent/license recordings under controlled on-chain conditions  

All implementation details remain private until launch.

My work includes protocol design, state modeling, settlement logic, session verification design, and early MVP implementation across **Solidity**, **rollups**, and **on-chain media architectures**.
